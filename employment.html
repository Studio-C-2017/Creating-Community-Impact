        <h1>Employment Services</h1>
        <h2 class="sub-title">Vocational Exploration:</h1>
        <p>Vocational Exploration is a customized service. It may be used to assist individuals in exploring different jobs and get experience through internships.</p>
        <p class="example">Example: Stephanie’s Job Developer/Employment Specialist, Gwyn, meets with her about the type of job she would like, and to learn about her strengths and interest. Gwyn has learned a lot about what Stephanie wants to do and enjoys. Gwyn takes Stephanie to meet the owners of a few shops in her community. They learned about what the employers needed and begin to see where her skills would be a good match.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-title">Assessment:</h2>
        <p>Vocational Rehabilitation may request an assessment of your skills to determine your support needs at work. There are two types of assessments that may be requested. One is a Trial Work Experience and the other a Community Based Assessment. Creating Community Impact provides this service.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-title">Portfolio:</h2>
        <p>Creating Community Impact may be asked by Vocational Rehabilitation to develop a Portfolio for you. This may include a Master Application, Personal Resume, Letters of Recommendation and Interview Skills. It is based upon your needs as identified by your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor and employment team.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-title">Job Development:</h2>
        <p>Our job development program is an exciting part of our work and the heart of what we strive to achieve for each job seeker. The job seekers we work with have various challenges in their lives. Job development is designed to help each job seeker achieve their full potential to work and achieve their unique goals. The Job Developer/Employment Specialist identifies career opportunities in the workplace which are unique to the work seeker.</p>
        <p>The job seekers skills and interests are used to ensure a successful match to their and their employer’s needs. Job Development may include support with the application and interview process, as well as visits with potential employers. The end goal is to assist the work seeker to become more successful, productive and independent. Additionally, our aim is to assist job seekers in finding sustainable employment so that each job seeker is eager to go to work each day because the job match works for them.</p>
        <p>Our mission is carried out through a variety of programs and services, all with one goal — to help people with disadvantages become more successful, productive, and independent. </p>

        <h2 class="sub-title">Job Coaching:</h2>
        <p>Job Coaching is available to help you learn new tasks and support your transition into your new career. Job Coaches can assist in teaching new skills if you are moved to a new position, or seeking promotion. They can help you build relationships with your coworkers, learn about the rules of the business, and support you in being successful at work. Additionally, we focus on job retention, making sure you are comfortable with your position and confident in your abilities.</p>
        <p class="example">Example: Stephanie worked hard and got a job at a local video shop! Her job coach, Julie, helps her learn the tasks she has in her new job. Julie works with Stephanie to make sure she knows how to do her job. She also supports Stephanie in learning how to tell her supervisor or co-workers when she needs help or additional direction, and to know her routine and schedule.</p>
