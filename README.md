Creating Community Impact is a job development company that seeks to assist individuals in finding sustainable employment that meets the needs of each individual. Everything is tailored to the individual whether it is during the Discovery process, Path to Employment, Community Based Work Assessments and/or Job Development. Additionally, we customize jobs that match the job seeker and employment site. Creating Community Impact works with individuals one at a time using a Person Centered Approach. On the job training, mentoring and ongoing evaluation and assessment ensure success for both the employer and the employee.

Our biggest goal is to help individuals with finding a job that meets their requirements. In order to assist individuals that seek the extra attention in finding a job we want to not only focus on a certain people, we want to help anyone that needs that help. We help any job seekers, employers, and anyone that asks the assistance of Creating Community Impact. With job seekers, we work with them in order to get incentives to get the employers to hire people with disabilities.
